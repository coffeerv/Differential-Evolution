This is a C99 implementation of the basic routine of the Differential Evolution algorithm by Storn & Price.
It checks boundaries and resets accordingly.

To use it, include differentialEvolution.h in your implementation.
Compilation is as usual, but as it makes use of C99 features, remember to compile using ONE of the following:

gcc -std=c99 myFile.c
clang myFile.c
